It is also possible your cache file is out-of-date; it may help to try:
  $ module --ignore_cache load "SQLite/3.33.0" "Python/3.8.6" "libffi/3.3" "Perl/5.32.0" "parallel/20210322" "GCCcore/10.2.0" "expat/2.2.9" "Tcl/8.6.10" "libreadline/8.0" "GMP/6.2.0"

Also make sure that all modulefiles written in TCL start with the string #%Module
